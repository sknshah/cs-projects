# CS Projects

Small systems and algorithms projects: game design, data structures, parsers, and similar problems, each built from scratch as a standalone implementation with an original design and test suite.

**Suggested GitHub topics:** `java` `algorithms` `software-design` `game-development` `python` `sql`

## Structure

inventory-rental-system/ <- role-based rental/checkout system, python + sqlite
battleship/ <- simple, single-player battleship game, html + css + javascript
password-toolkit/ <- password strength checker and passphrase generator, java

## Projects

| Project | Concept area | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [inventory-rental-system](projects/inventory-rental-system) | business logic, relational data, concurrency | Role-based equipment rental/checkout system: category rules, late fees, reservations, and concurrency-safe checkout, built on Python and SQLite. |
| [battleship](projects/battleship) | interactive game design, event-driven UI | A simple, single-player Battleship game playable in the browser, with a built-in rules and background panel and a from-scratch computer opponent. |
| [password-toolkit](projects/password-toolkit) | security, entropy estimation, randomness | A command line toolkit that estimates real password strength (entropy, breached-password and pattern detection) and generates secure diceware-style passphrases, built on plain Java. |
